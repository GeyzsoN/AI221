# AI 221: Classical Machine Learning

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our course: AI 221 Classical Machine Learning. This repository contains both Python codes (Jupyter notebooks) and MATLAB codes used in class.
AI 221 is intended for 2nd term graduate students at the Artificial Intelligence Program at the College of Engineering, University of the Philippines, Diliman.
Pre-requisite knowledge on linear algebra (AI 211), optimization theory, basic statistics, and calculus are required.

## Usage
The repository is organized into folders based on the weekly topics covered in the class, as follows:
- Introduction to Machine Learning
- [Linear and Logistic Regression](/Linear_and_Logistic_Regression)
- Kernel Methods
- Cross-validation and Hyper-parameter Search
- Linear Dimensionality Reduction and LDA
- Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction
- Clustering, Density Estimation, Anomaly Detection
- Ensemble Learning
- Neural Networks, Part 1
- Neural Networks, Part 2
- Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization
- AutoML and Explainable AI (XAI)
